## **Overview**
This project investigates **European royal family networks** through **graph analytics**, **Wikipedia API data extraction**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
It models monarchic relationships as a **knowledge graph** to study correlations between **inbreeding coefficients**, **social connectivity**, and **biographical sentiment analysis** derived from publicly available historical data.  

The analysis combines **network science**, **computational genealogy**, and **text mining** to uncover patterns in dynastic interrelations and hereditary impact over time.

## üöÄ **Key Features & Contributions**

### üß© **1. Automated Data Extraction**
- Implemented **web scraping** using the **Wikipedia RESTful API** to extract structured data from monarch biography infoboxes.  
- Parsed relationship attributes (e.g., `parents`, `spouses`, `predecessors`, `successors`) using **JSON query pipelines**.  
- Applied **data validation**, **entity resolution**, and **error handling** to ensure robust data ingestion.

> **Keywords:** Wikipedia API, JSON parsing, RESTful endpoints, data pipeline automation, entity disambiguation.

---

### üåê **2. Graph Construction & Analysis**
- Built a **multi-relational social graph** with **NetworkX**, modeling **royal individuals as nodes** and **family or political connections as edges**.  
- Edge attributes encoded **relationship types**: `blood`, `marriage`, and `succession`.  
- Node attributes included temporal metadata (`birth/death`, `reign start/end`) and computed genetic coefficients.  
- Computed **structural graph metrics**:
  - *Degree centrality*  
  - *Betweenness centrality*  
  - *Graph connectivity* and *component analysis*  
  - *Community modularity*  

> **Keywords:** graph analytics, knowledge graph, NetworkX, adjacency matrix, social network analysis (SNA), community detection, degree distribution, connected components.

---

### üß¨ **3. Inbreeding Coefficient Computation**
- Implemented a recursive computation of the **inbreeding coefficient** for each individual node:
f(X) = Œ£ [ 0.5^(n - 1) * (1 + f(A)) ]

where:
- `n` ‚Üí number of individuals in the ancestral loop between the parents and common ancestor  
- `f(A)` ‚Üí inbreeding coefficient of the common ancestor  

- Mapped **coefficient distributions** across dynasties and time periods to identify **genealogical bottlenecks**.  
- Compared inbreeding scores across centuries (1450‚Äì1700 vs. 1920+) to study **temporal trends in hereditary practices**.

> **Keywords:** graph-based inheritance modeling, genealogical inference, recursive algorithms, computational biology, historical data analytics.

---

### üß† **4. Natural Language Processing & Sentiment Analysis**
- Extracted biographical text from Wikipedia pages using **NLP preprocessing** techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).  
- Performed **sentiment analysis** with the **NLTK SentimentIntensityAnalyzer** to evaluate emotional tone and correlate it with health or leadership attributes in monarch biographies.  
- Identified **statistical shifts** in sentiment distributions between high- and low-inbreeding groups.

> **Keywords:** sentiment analysis, text mining, NLTK, feature extraction, computational linguistics, historical text analytics, data-driven storytelling.

---

### üìä **5. Visualization & Reporting**
- Created **interactive visualizations** using **Plotly** and **Matplotlib** for:
- Graph connectivity patterns  
- Inbreeding distribution histograms  
- Temporal evolution of coefficients  
- Sentiment polarity comparisons  
- Generated **data-driven insights** supported by **reproducible Jupyter notebooks**.

> **Keywords:** data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Plotly, Matplotlib, network diagrams, Jupyter reproducibility.
